Notes:
- think I will use p3.8xlarge instances since less RAM (244GB) to fill up

Image Segmentation

Run all experiments: with 1 GPU and all GPUs

0 - default run:
    dataset < RAM
    expected: similar results as last time

1 - naive duplication
    copy paste input files until > RAM

2 - noise add + duplication
    copy paste input files + add random noise to each until > RAM

- Do we want to try multiple levels of scaling? i.e. 2x RAM, 10x RAM ?
- Same experiements but by reducing the RAM avilable to process. 

Goal is to see if the fake data behaves the same as real
Achieve same scaling factors with only real data.

- enable checkpointing (run with first)


TODO:

- make table of experiments (high priority)
- check out NVIDIA nsight tool. Apparently better for tracing GPU than smi which is not very accurate. (low priority)

- mmap tracing (reach out to Bryan)
    what is the mmap doing? inter thread comms less intersting, if handles data yes

- (nice to have) Setup automated VM launch and test parametrization infra.

- Port to tensorflow. 
    Will need to validate the algorithm by doing a full training run and seeing if the desired accuracy is reached

- what next?
